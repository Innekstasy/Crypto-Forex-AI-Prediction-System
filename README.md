# 📈 Crypto Forex AI Prediction System

**An open-source system for automated Forex prediction powered by AI**  
Built to be modular, scalable, and easy to improve with community collaboration.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

To create a system that predicts trading signals on Forex pairs with **Take Profit** and **Stop Loss** values generated by an AI model that is constantly trained in a loop.

This is not a commercial service or paid product.  
It's a free, shareable, community-driven tool. The idea is simple:

> 📉 Remove emotion from trading decisions.  
> 🤖 Use AI to generate objective predictions.  
> 🌍 Share it with anyone who wants to contribute or benefit from it.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Select a Forex pair**
2. **Fetch historical and live data** from multiple APIs (Yahoo, Binance, CoinGecko, etc.)
3. **Apply technical analysis** using indicators (RSI, Fibonacci, Wyckoff, candlestick patterns, etc.)
4. **Train AI models** daily or in real time
5. **Generate predictions** for TP / SL using RandomForest and XGBoost
6. **Display results** through a Streamlit web dashboard

## 🤝 What I'm Looking For

The system works, but it's still evolving. I’d love help with:

- Debugging and stabilizing the workflow
- Suggestions for new features or indicators
- Testing on other assets, brokers, or timeframes
- Code review, optimization, or general improvements

## 💬 Why Is It Free?

I'm not looking to monetize this with subscriptions, licenses, or upsells.  
I believe in **abundance and open collaboration**.

Maybe this won’t change the world, but if it helps someone make a few extra bucks or learn something useful — that’s already worth it.
